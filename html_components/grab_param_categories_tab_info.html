<div class="content">
    <p>The 'category' and 'param_name' columns can be maximum 45 characters long.</p>
    <p>The 'category' and 'param_name' fields are mandatory.</p>
    <p>The <code>NULL</code> keyword must be entered to explicitly delete a non-mandatory value.</p>
    <p>The rows can be resorted by dragging and dropping them at their new location. The draggable zone is the first column. The 'Update Order' button must be pressed to save the changes. Beware that to have the expected result, the table must be sorted in ascending order using the 'order' column and must not be filtered.</p>
