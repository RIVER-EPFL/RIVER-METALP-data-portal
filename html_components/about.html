                    Through this data portal, visitors can explore the more than 15'000'000 data recorded in our monitoring network over 4 years using specific interactive plots designed for grab samples and sensor measurements. Data can also be requested by selecting the chosen parameters, dates and study sites in the Download tab.

                    The role of streams and rivers for the global carbon cycle is now increasingly understood. However, the streams that drain the roof of our planet are rarely included in considerations of global biogeochemistry. This is surprising given the wide distribution of high-mountain ranges. At the same time, it is also understandable given the numerous logistical challenges associated with the study of remote high-mountain streams.

                    The <a href="https://metalp.epfl.ch">METALP{{ extLinkIcon }}</a> project at the <a href="https://www.epfl.ch">Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL){{ extLinkIcon }}</a> operates an environmental sensor network to study the hydrology and biogeochemistry of streams in four high-mountain catchments in Switzerland. We use high-resolution data over multiple years to establish regimes of streamwater flow, temperature, fine sediment load, and carbon fluxes, including CO<sub>2</sub> exchange with the atmosphere, and ecosystem metabolism. This unique observatory aims at better understanding the effects of climate change, including glacier shrinkage, on critical stream ecosystem functions and integrity.
